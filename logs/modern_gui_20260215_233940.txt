BOT: You’re likely thinking of **AI Tinkerers**!

It is a global community of technical practitioners—developers, researchers, and hackers—who are actively building with generative AI. 

Key things to know:
*   **Meetups:** They host local events in cities worldwide where members show live demos of their projects.
*   **Focus:** It’s strictly for "tinkerers" (people who code and build) rather than just enthusiasts or sales pitches.
*   **Goal:** To share knowledge, collaborate, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with LLMs and generative tools.

Are you looking to join a local chapter or build something specific?
